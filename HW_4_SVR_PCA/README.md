Using the cancer dataset, split the dataset into 80 percent training size and 20 percent validation
size. For problem #1, the dataset will be using the SVM classifer and the PCA feature extraction on
the training model. The classification report will plotted over the numbers of principal components
to compared the precision, recall, and accuracy. For problem #2, the housing dataset will be using
the SVR regression model to predicts housing price and also using PCA feature extraction. Different
kernal types will be used for comparing the results to others.
