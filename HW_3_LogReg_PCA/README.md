Using the cancer dataset, split the dataset into 80 percent training size and 20 percent validation
size. For problem #1, the dataset will be using the Naive Bayesian model and compare
the results to logistic regression classifier. For problem #2, the dataset use 
the logisitic regression, but using the PCA extraction on the training. For
problem #3, repeat problem #2 but with the Naive Bayesian model.
